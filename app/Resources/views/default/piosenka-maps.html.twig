<center><h1>Maroon 5 - Maps</h1></center><br /><br />
<pre>
I miss the taste of a sweeter life<br />
I miss the conversation<br />
I’m searching for a song tonight<br />
I’m changing all of the stations<br />
I like to think that we had it all<br />
We drew a map to a better place<br />
But on that road I took a fall<br />
Oh baby why did you run away?<br /><br />

I was there for you<br />
In your darkest times<br />
I was there for you<br />
In your darkest nights<br /><br />

But I wonder where were you?<br />
When I was at my worst<br />
Down on my knees<br />
And you said you had my back<br />
So I wonder where were you?<br />
When all the roads you took came back to me<br />
So I’m following the map that leads to you<br />
The map that leads to you<br />
Ain’t nothin' I can do<br />
The map that leads to you<br />
Following, following, following to you<br />
The map that leads to you<br />
Ain’t nothin' I can do<br />
The map that leads to you<br />
Following, following, following<br /><br />
</pre>
