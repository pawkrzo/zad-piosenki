    <h1>Skillet - Hero</h1>
    <pre>
I'm just a step away
I'm just a breath away
Losing my faith today
(We're falling off the edge today)

I am just a man
Not superhuman (I'm not superhuman)
Someone save me from the hate

It's just another war
Just another family torn (We're falling from our faith today)
Just a step from the edge
Just another day in the world we live

(Ref)
I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero (To save me now)
I need a hero to save my life
A hero'll save me (Just in time)

I've gotta fight today
To live another day
Speaking my mind today
(My voice will be heard today)

I've gotta make a stand
But I am just a man
(I'm not superhuman)
My voice will be heard today

It's just another war
Just another family torn (My voice will be heard today)
It's just another kill
The countdown begins to destroy ourselves

I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero (To save me now)
I need a hero to save my life
A hero'll save me (Just in time)

I need a hero to save my life
I need a hero just in time
Save me just in time
Save me just in time

Who's gonna fight for what's right?
Who's gonna help us survive?
We're in the fight of our lives
(And we're not ready to die)

Who's gona fight for the weak?
Who's gonna make 'em believe?
I've got a hero (I've got a hero)
Living in me

I'm gonna fight for what's right
Today I'm speaking my mind
And if it kills me tonight
(I will be ready to die)

A hero's not afraid to give his life
A hero's gonna save me just in time

I need a hero to save me now
I need a hero (To save me now)
I need a hero to save my life
A hero'll save me (Just in time)

I need a hero
(Who's gonna fight for what's right, who's gonna help us survive?)
I need a hero
(Who's gonna fight for the weak, who's gonna make 'em believe?)
I need a hero
I need a hero

A hero's gonna save me just in time
    </pre>
