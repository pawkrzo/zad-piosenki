When I look into your eyes 
I can see a love restrained 
But darling when I hold you 
Don't you know I feel the same 

Cause nothin' lasts forever 
And we both know hearts can change 
And it's hard to hold a candle 
In the cold November rain 

We've been through this such a long time 
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oh yeah

But lovers always come and lovers always go 
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today 
Walking away 

If we could take the time to lay it on the line 
I could rest my head 
just knowin' that you were mine 
All mine 
So if you want to love me 
Then darlin' don't refrain 
Or I'll just end up walkin' 
In the cold November rain 

Do you need some time.. on your own 
Do you need some time.. all alone 
Everybody needs some time.. on their own 
Don't you know you need some time.. all alone 

I know it's hard to keep an open heart 
When even friends seem out to harm you 
But if you could heal a broken heart 
Wouldn't time be out to charm you 

SOLO 1

Sometimes I need some time.. on my own 
Sometimes I need some time.. all alone 
Everybody needs some time.. on their own 
Don't you know you need some time.. all alone 

SOLO 2

And when your fears subside 
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me 
When there's no one left to blame 
So never mind the darkness 
We still can find a way 
Cause nothin' lasts forever 
Even cold November rain 

SOLO 3

Don't ya think that you need somebody 
Don't ya think that you need someone 
Everybody needs somebody 
You're not the only one x2 (all x3)
